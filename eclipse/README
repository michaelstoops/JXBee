The JXBee project helps Java programmers access Digi(TM) XBee(TM) devices.

This project includes both a library that does most of the work, and a command-line executable. The executable itself is both a demonstration of how to use the library, and a very useful command-line client for XBee devices.

Features:
- Communicates with XBee Wi-Fi modules using standard Wi-Fi. No serial cable or other special hardware required.
- Requires only a remote XBee module, not a remote module plus a local module.
- Supports any number of connections at the same time: any number of XBee modules and/or Java clients.
- Supports all XBee I/O pins, sending and receiving* data through the XBee's serial port.
- Very portable, tested on Windows, Linux, and Android. Should work on anything else that supports JavaSE 1.6.
- MIT License, use the software for whatever you want.

Caveats:
- Doesn't yet support the ZigBee, 802.15.4, DigiMesh and other families of XBee devices, because PCs don't tend to have the radios to talk with them. Tunneling through a serial cable or XIG may be supported in the future.
* Doesn't yet receive serial data from the XBee module.

Possible future features:
- Proper testing scheme with JUnit.
