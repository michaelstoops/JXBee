The JXBee project helps Java programmers access Digi(TM) XBee(TM) devices.

The JXBeeLib portion of the code is a Java library providing:
- Java representations of the definitions and models used in Digi's XBee family of products.
- Classes meant to make it easy for a Java programmer to establish and manage a connection to an XBee device.

The JXBeeTool portion of the code is a Java application providing convenient command-line access to XBee devices. It borrows from the style of other common *NIX tools such as wget and svn. With a simple command line you can send data to an XBee device or pull information from it.

Right now, JXBee is limited to communicating with the Wi-Fi(TM) family of XBee modules. Most of the families of XBee modules require your computer, a serial cable to one XBee module, and another XBee module that you actually want to talk to wirelessly. Wi-Fi is much simpler because your computer already has a compatible network. You don't need to buy two XBee modules, just one.

Also, the library only works correctly with one connection at a time. Packet routing and queuing isn't implemented, but there is a place for it.  

Possible future features include:
- Add proper routing of packets to their connection object. Right now they go to the first connection that asks for a packet.
- Support for the other XBee module families and serial connections.
- XBee module simulator, software that pretends to be an XBee module. Would be useful for testing.
- Communication tunneling so that you can establish communication with a XBee module as though you had it connected by serial or Wi-Fi to your machine, no matter how far away you actually are.
