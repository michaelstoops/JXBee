The JXBee project helps Java programmers access Digi(TM) XBee(TM) devices.

The JXBeeLib portion of the code is a Java library providing:
- Java representations of the definitions and models used in the basis of Digi's XBee family of products.
- Classes meant to make it easy for a Java programmer to establish and manage a connection to an XBee device and communicate with it.

The JXBeeTool portion of the code is a Java application providing convenient command-line access to XBee devices. It borrows from the style of other common *NIX tools such as wget and svn. With a simple command line you can send data to an XBee device or pull information from it.

Right now, JXBee is limited to communicating over TCP/IP to the Wi-Fi(TM) family of XBee modules. The TCP/IP connection was implemented first because it doesn't require any hardware to communicate with the XBee module beyond the ubiquitous Wi-Fi connection. The other families of XBee modules all communicate with computers via serial cable and use various wireless protocols to talk to each other.

Also, the library only works correctly with one connection at a time. Packet routing and queuing isn't implemented, but there is a place for it.  

Possible future features include:
- Add proper routing of packets to their connection object. Right now they go to the first connection that asks for a packet.
- Support for the other XBee module families and serial connections.
- XBee module simulator, software that pretends to be an XBee module. Would be useful for testing.
- Communication tunneling so that you can establish communication with a XBee module as though you had it connected by serial or Wi-Fi to your machine, no matter how far away you actually are.
